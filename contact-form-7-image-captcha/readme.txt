Adds a clean image captcha to Contact Form 7

== Description ==

Add an SVG image captcha and honeypot to your contact form 7 form. This CAPTCHA is GDPR compliant and becuase the images are inline SVG's, this plugin will not slow down your site with additional header requests like Google's ReCAPTCHA.

= Directions [PLEASE READ] =
Add the shortcode [cf7ic] to the form editor where you want the captcha to appear.

As of version 3.2.0, **Contact Form 7 Conditional Fields** is now fully supported! You no longer need to add `[hidden kc_captcha "kc_human"]` to your forms that do not include the [cf7ic] shortcode.

All versions in 3.1.#, require that you add `[hidden kc_captcha "kc_human"]` to the form if that form does not include the [cf7ic] shortcode, otherwise those forms **will not submit**.

You can hide the CAPTCHA until a user interacts with the form, by adding "toggle" to the shortcode.
`[cf7ic "toggle"]`

= IMPORTANT 3.0 NOTICE =
Version 3.0.0 uses SVG's instead of font icons, I have tested the changes to make sure the update would not cause any noticeable changes, however if you notice any issues, please let me know. That said, for those who have added their own custom CSS styling, you may need to update your css to account for the icon change.

= Supported Languages =

* Croatian     (Thanks @peraburek)
* French       (Thanks deuns26)
* German       (Thanks  Te-Punkt & bkmh)

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `[cf7ic]` to your contact form 7 forms

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you add the image captcha to the forms? =

Simply add this shortcode `[cf7ic]` to your contact form

= How do you use the toggle feature? =

To make it so the CAPTCHA only shows when the form is being filled out, add "toggle" to the shortcode `[cf7ic "toggle"]` in your contact form.

= Toggle is not working =

The most likely reason the toggle is not working is because the double quotes around the word toggle has been changed to "smart quotes", meaning that they are opening and closing quotation marks and not the verticle lines. 

To fix, simply delete the quotes and re-add them with your keyboard - do not copy and paste.
