Our top priority is **compliance with the laws and the regulations of courts and of data protection authorities**. We do not offer options that are not legally or legally highly controversial.

**Why so strict?** Because our users have neither the desire nor the budget to lead complex procedures through all appeals, just to find out whether any cool feature is legally permissible or not.

**But don't worry:** there are never any end features, just scroll down, down, down ... :)

# **LAWYER CREATED**

All legal texts were created by the law firm Marketingrecht.eu, which specializes in IT, internet and data protection law.
