Accept PayPal, Credit Cards, and Debit Cards on your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==

The Braintree for WooCommerce gateway lets you accept **credit cards and PayPal payments** on your WooCommerce store via Braintree. Customers can save their credit card details or link a PayPal account to their WooCommerce user account for fast and easy checkout.

With this gateway, you can **securely sell your products** online using Hosted Fields, which help you meet security requirements without sacrificing flexibility or an integrated checkout process. Hosted Fields, similar to iFrames, are hosted on PayPal's servers but fit inside the checkout form elements on your site, providing a **secure, seamless** means for customers to share their payment information.

Braintree for WooCommerce supports tokenization, letting your customers save their credit cards or connect their PayPal account for faster, easier subsequent checkouts. The gateway also supports <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/" target="_blank">WooCommerce Subscriptions</a> to let you sell products with recurring billing and <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/" target="_blank">WooCommerce Pre-Orders</a>, which supports accepting payments for upcoming products as they ship or up-front.

= Powering Advanced Payments =

Braintree for WooCommerce provides several advanced features for transaction processing and payment method management.

- Meets [PCI Compliance SAQ-A](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Understanding_SAQs_PCI_DSS_v3.pdf) standards
- Supports [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), and [WooCommerce Pre-Orders](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/)
- Customers can securely save credit cards or link PayPal accounts to your site
- Easily process refunds, void transactions, and capture charges right from WooCommerce
- Route payments in different currencies to different Braintree accounts (requires currency switcher)
- Supports Braintree's [extensive suite of fraud tools](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/guides/fraud-tools/overview)
- Supports 3D Secure
- Includes express checkout options like Buy Now buttons on product pages and PayPal Connect buttons in the Cart
- ...and much more!

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

- PHP 5.4+ (you can see this under <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Status</strong>)</li>
- WooCommerce 2.6+
- WordPress 4.4+
- An SSL certificate
- cURL support (most hosts have this enabled by default)

= Installation =

[Click here for instructions on installing plugins on your WordPress site.](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins) We recommend using automatic installation as the simplest method.

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm, though we do recommend creating a backup of your site before updating, just in case.

If you do encounter an issue after updating, you may need to flush site permalinks by going to **Settings > Permalinks** and clicking **Save Changes**. That will usually return things to normal!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find documentation? =

Great question! [Click here to review Braintree for WooCommerce documentation.](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-powered-by-braintree/) This documentation includes detailed setup instructions and information about using the gateway's features.

= Does this plugin work with credit cards, or just PayPal? =

This plugin supports payments with credit cards and PayPal.

= Does this plugin support recurring payment, like for subscriptions? =

Yes! This plugin supports tokenization, which is required for recurring payments such as those created with [WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).

= What currencies are supported? =

This plugin supports all countries in which Braintree is available. You can use your native currency, or you can add multiple merchant IDs to process different currencies via different Braintree accounts. To use multi-currency, your site must use a **currency switcher** to adjust the order currency (may require purchase). We’ve tested this plugin with the [Aelia Currency Switcher](https://aelia.co/shop/currency-switcher-woocommerce/) (requires purchase).

= Can non-US merchants use this plugin? =

Yes! This plugin supports all countries where Braintree is available.

= Does this plugin support testing and production modes? =

Yes! This plugin includes a production and sandbox mode so you can test without activating live payments.

= Credit cards are working fine, but PayPal's not working. What's going on? =

It sounds like you may need to enable PayPal on your Braintree account. [Click here for instructions on enabling PayPal in your Braintree control panel.](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-powered-by-braintree/#section-6)

= Can I use this plugin just for PayPal? =

Sure thing! [Click here for instructions on setting up this gateway to only accept PayPal payments.](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-powered-by-braintree#section-10)

= Will this plugin work with my site's theme? =

Braintree for WooCommerce should work nicely with any WooCommerce compatible theme (such as [Storefront](http://www.woocommerce.com/storefront/)), but may require some styling for a perfect fit. For assistance with theme customization, please visit the [WooCommerce Codex](https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/woocommerce-codex/).

= Where can I get support, request new features, or report bugs? =

First, please [check out our plugin documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-powered-by-braintree) to see if that addresses any of your questions or concerns.

If not, please get in touch with us through the [plugin forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-powered-by-braintree/)!
